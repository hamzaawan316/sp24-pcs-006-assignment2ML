# Question: Write a paragraph about your experience of working with the standard ML pipeline in your own words?
I started by manually extracting features from a dataset of names, which taught me the importance of carefully selecting and input features to improve model performance. Creating features like name length, vowel count, and first and last letters helped me understand how raw data can be transformed into useful inputs for a classifier. After converting the dataset to ARFF format, I loaded it into WEKA, which provided an intuitive interface for data exploration and classification. Running the J48 decision tree algorithm allowed me to see how different features influenced classification accuracy. It was interesting to observe that even small changes in features could lead to obvious differences in performance. Overall, the process emphasized the importance of feature, data format handling, and the power of visualizing and analysing results in a structured ML pipeline.
